Application explained: 

When a user is logged in (new users must register), they are able to search for books by title or author. Then, they will be presented with the search results and can click on a given book. When they click on the book's link, they are given a description of the book and the option to add it to their "want to read" or "already read" list. Then, they return to the homepage, where they can repeat these steps. On the homepage, they also have the option to "click to see your lists" or to see how many items are in each list. When you click the "click to see your list" option, users are shown both book lists and the description corresponding to each book.
