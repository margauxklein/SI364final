Large sections, especially in the later chapters, are philosophical discussion rather than narrative. He also said that the best Russian literature does not conform to standards and hence hesitated to call War and Peace a novel. Instead, he regarded Anna Karenina as his first true novel.

He at last discovers the Tolstoyan truth that wisdom is to be found not in systems but in the ordinary processes of daily life, especially in his marriage to the novel’s most memorable heroine, Natasha. \n\nBoth an intimate study of individual passions and an epic history of Russia and its people, War and Peace is nothing more or less than a complete portrait of human existence.\n\n\nJoseph Frank is Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature at Princeton University and Professor Emeritus of Comparative Literature and Slavic Languages and Literature at Stanford University.

To read him is to find one's way home, to everything within us that is fundamental and sane.’ Thomas Mann<br /><br />‘What an artist and what a psychologist! It seems to me there are some passages worthy of Shakespeare. I found myself crying out in admiration while reading.’ Gustave Flaubert<br /><br />About the author<br /><br />Leo Tolstoy was born in 1828 in Tula, near Moscow. His parents, who both died when he was young, belonged to the Russian nobility, and to the end of his life Tolstoy remained conscious of his aristocratic status. His novels, ‘War and Peace’ and ‘Anna Karenina’ are literary classics and he is revered as one of the greatest writers of the nineteenth century. He died in 1910 at the age of 82.<br /><br />Andrew Bromfield was born in Yorkshire and lives in Surrey, having spent several long periods living in Moscow, where he cofounded and edited ‘Glas’. He is best known for his English translations of the work of Victor Pelevin and Boris Akunin.", 'releaseDate': '2007-04-02T07:00:00Z', 'artistViewUrl': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/leo-tolstoy/2718686?mt=11&uo=4', 'kind': 'ebook', 'trackViewUrl': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/war-and-peace/id391572237?mt=11&uo=4', 'artistIds': [2718686], 'genreIds': ['10042', '38', '9031'], 'artistId': 2718686, 'genres': ['Classics', 'Books', 'Fiction & Literature'], 'fileSizeBytes': 5131175, 'trackName': 'War and Peace', 'currency': 'USD', 'price': 1.99, 'artworkUrl60': 'http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication/v4/1e/be/82/1ebe82f7-afad-ac14-3fc7-b23747cbd8f9/source/60x60bb.jpg', 'formattedPrice': '$1.99', 'trackId': 391572237, 'trackCensoredName': 'War and Peace', 'artistName': 'Leo Tolstoy', 'artworkUrl100': 'http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication/v4/1e/be/82/1ebe82f7-afad-ac14-3fc7-b23747cbd8f9/source/100x100bb.jpg'}, {'description': '<b><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY</b><br /> <b><i>The New York Times Book Review • The Economist • The Christian Science Monitor • Bloomberg Businessweek • The Globe and Mail</i></b><br /></b><br />From the bestselling and award-winning author of <i>Paris 1919</i> comes a masterpiece of narrative nonfiction, a fascinating portrait of Europe from 1900 up to the outbreak of World War I. <br /> &#xa0;<br /> The century since the end of the Napoleonic wars had been the most peaceful era Europe had known since the fall of the Roman Empire. In the first years of the twentieth century, Europe believed it was marching to a golden, happy, and prosperous future. But instead, complex personalities and rivalries, colonialism and ethnic nationalisms, and shifting alliances helped to bring about the failure of the long peace and the outbreak of a war that transformed Europe and the world. <br /> <i>&#xa0;</i><br /> <i>The War That Ended Peace </i>brings vividly to life the military leaders, politicians, diplomats, bankers, and the extended, interrelated family of crowned heads<b> </b>across Europe who failed to stop the descent into war: in Germany, the mercurial Kaiser Wilhelm II and the chief of the German general staff, Von Moltke the Younger; in Austria-Hungary, Emperor Franz Joseph, a man who tried, through sheer hard work, to stave off the coming chaos in his empire; in Russia, Tsar Nicholas II and his wife; in Britain, King Edward VII, Prime Minister Herbert Asquith, and British admiral Jacky Fisher, the fierce advocate of naval reform who entered into the arms race with Germany that pushed the continent toward confrontation on land and sea.<br /> &#xa0;<br /> There are the would-be peacemakers as well, among them prophets of the horrors of future wars whose warnings went unheeded: Alfred Nobel, who donated his fortune to the cause of international understanding, and Bertha von Suttner, a writer and activist who was the first woman awarded Nobel’s new Peace Prize. Here too we meet the urbane and cosmopolitan Count Harry Kessler, who noticed many of the early signs that something was stirring in Europe; the young Winston Churchill, then First Lord of the Admiralty and a rising figure in British politics; Madame Caillaux, who shot a man who might have been a force for peace; and more. With indelible portraits, MacMillan shows how the fateful decisions of a few powerful people changed the course of history. <br /> &#xa0;<br /> Taut, suspenseful, and impossible to put down, <i>The War That Ended Peace</i> is also a wise cautionary reminder of how wars happen in spite of the near-universal desire to keep the peace. Destined to become a classic in the tradition of Barbara Tuchman’s <i>The Guns of August</i>, <i>The War That Ended Peace</i> enriches our understanding of one of the defining periods and events of the twentieth century.<br /> &#xa0;<br /> <b>Praise for <i>The War That Ended Peace</i></b><br /> &#xa0;<br />“Magnificent . . . <i>The War That Ended Peace</i> will certainly rank among the best books of the centennial crop.”<b>—<i>The Economist</i> </b><br /> &#xa0;<br /> “Superb.”<b>—<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></b><br /> <i>&#xa0;</i><br /> “Masterly . . . marvelous . . .

Through the use of fictional narrative, Tolstoy utilizes a huge cast of characters, centering on five aristocratic Russian families in 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars. These characters, particularly Pierre, Prince Andrei, and the beautiful Natasha, demonstrate different human struggles that are affected by their history, present era, and culture. They simultaneously develop the concepts on which Tolstoy expounds in the thematic essays interspersed throughout the narrative: a person&#39;s free will and the shaping of historical events, morality in an imperfect world, youth and age, marriage and death, and, of course, war and peace, in a work so groundbreaking that it was not considered a novel when published in 1865.

His first career, beginning as an army intelligence officer and including a distinguished run as one of Congress’s most powerful and respected members, lasted thirty-five years and culminated in his transformational role as Clinton’s budget czar and White House chief of staff. He then “retired” to establish the Panetta Institute with his wife of fifty years, Sylvia; to serve on the Iraq Study Group; and to protect his beloved California coastline. But in 2009, he accepted what many said was a thankless task: returning to public office as the director of the CIA, taking it from a state of turmoil after the Bush-era torture debates and moving it back to the vital center of America’s war against Al Qaeda, including the campaign that led to the killing of Osama bin Laden. And then, in the wake of bin Laden’s death, Panetta became the U.S. secretary of defense, inheriting two troubled wars in a time of austerity and painful choices.<br /><br />Like his career, <i>Worthy Fights</i> is a reflection of Panetta’s values. It is imbued with the frank, grounded, and often quite funny spirit of a man who never lost touch with where he came from: his family’s walnut farm in beautiful Carmel Valley, California. It is also a testament to a lost kind of political leadership, which favors progress and duty to country over partisanship. Panetta is a Democrat who pushed for balanced budgets while also expanding care for the elderly and sick; a devout Catholic who opposes the death penalty but had to weigh every drone strike from 2009 through 2011. Throughout his career, Panetta’s polestar has been his belief that a public servant’s real choice is between leadership or crisis. Troubles always come about through no fault of one’s own, but most can be prevented with courage and foresight.<br /><br />As always, Panetta calls them as he sees them in <i>Worthy Fights</i>. Suffused with its author’s decency and stubborn common sense, the book is an epic American success story, a great political memoir, and a revelatory view onto many of the great figures and events of our time.', 'releaseDate': '2014-10-07T07:00:00Z', 'artistViewUrl': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/leon-panetta-jim-newton/583251720?mt=11&uo=4', 'kind': 'ebook', 'trackViewUrl': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/worthy-fights/id828760521?mt=11&uo=4', 'userRatingCount': 61, 'artistIds': [583251720, 329097496], 'genreIds': ['10079', '38', '9015', '9034', '9008'], 'artistId': 583251720, 'genres': ['United States', 'Books', 'History', 'Politics & Current Events', 'Biographies & Memoirs'], 'fileSizeBytes': 21890830, 'trackName': 'Worthy Fights', 'currency': 'USD', 'price': 13.99, 'artworkUrl60': 'http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication3/v4/64/bd/32/64bd32e4-2748-4448-f3cb-47a70d00e281/source/60x60bb.jpg', 'formattedPrice': '$13.99', 'averageUserRating': 4.0, 'trackId': 828760521, 'trackCensoredName': 'Worthy Fights', 'artistName': 'Leon Panetta & Jim Newton', 'artworkUrl100': 'http://is3.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication3/v4/64/bd/32/64bd32e4-2748-4448-f3cb-47a70d00e281/source/100x100bb.jpg'}, {'description': 'War and Peace is a novel by the Russian author Leo Tolstoy. It is regarded as one of the central works of world literature. War and Peace and Tolstoy\'s other major prose work, Anna Karenina (1873–77), are considered Tolstoy\'s finest literary achievements.<br />The novel charts the history of the French invasion of Russia, and the impact of the Napoleonic era on Tsarist society, through the stories of five Russian aristocratic families. Portions of an earlier version, titled The Year 1805, were serialized in The Russian Messenger between 1865 and 1867. The novel was first published in its entirety in 1869. Newsweek in 2009 ranked it first in its Top 100 Books. In 2003, the novel was listed at number 20 on the BBC\'s survey The Big Read.<br />Tolstoy himself said that War and Peace was "not a novel, even less is it a poem, and still less a historical chronicle".

He was also influenced by many other novels. A veteran of the Crimean War, Tolstoy was quite critical of standard history, especially the standards of military history, in War and Peace. Tolstoy read all the standard histories available in Russian and French about the Napoleonic Wars and combined more traditional historical writing with the novel form. He explains at the start of the novel\'s third volume his own views on how history ought to be written. His aim was to blur the line between fiction and history, in order to get closer to the truth, as he states in Volume II.<br /><br />The novel is set 60 years earlier than the time at which Tolstoy wrote it, "in the days of our grandfathers", as he puts it. He had spoken with people who had lived through war during the French invasion of Russia in 1812, so the book is also, in part, accurate ethnography fictionalized. He read letters, journals, autobiographical and biographical materials pertaining to Napoleon and the dozens of other historical characters in the novel. There are approximately 160 real persons named or referred to in War and Peace.<br /><br />Plot summary:<br />War and Peace has a large cast of characters, the majority of whom are introduced in the first book.<br /><br />Some are actual historical figures, such as Napoleon and Alexander I. While the scope of the novel is vast, it is centered around five aristocratic families. The plot and the interactions of the characters take place in the era surrounding the 1812 French invasion of Russia during the Napoleonic wars.<br />Book/Volume One<br />The novel begins in July 1805 in Saint Petersburg, at a soiree given by Anna Pavlovna Scherer—the maid of honour and confidante to the queen mother Maria Feodorovna. Many of the main characters and aristocratic families in the novel are introduced as they enter Anna Pavlovna\'s salon. Pierre (Pyotr Kirilovich) Bezukhov is the illegitimate son of a wealthy count, an elderly man who is dying after a series of strokes. Pierre is about to become embroiled in a struggle for his inheritance. Educated abroad at his father\'s expense following his mother\'s death, Pierre is essentially kindhearted, but socially awkward, and owing in part to his open, finds it difficult to integrate into Petersburg society. It is known to everyone at soiree that Pierre is his father\'s favorite of all the old count’s illegitimate children.<br /><br />Also attending the soireé is Pierre\'s friend, the intelligent and sardonic Prince Andrei Nikolayevich Bolkonsky, husband of Lise, the charming society favourite. Finding Petersburg society unctuous and disillusioned with married life after discovering his wife is empty and superficial, Prince Andrei makes the fateful choice to be an aide-de-camp to Prince Mikhail Ilarionovich Kutuzov in the coming war against Napoleon.<br /><br />The plot moves to Moscow, Russia\'s ancient city and former capital, contrasting its provincial, more Russian ways to the highly mannered society of Petersburg. The Rostov family are introduced. Count Ilya Andreyevich Rostov has four adolescent children. Thirteen-year-old Natasha (Natalia Ilyinichna) believes herself in love with Boris Drubetskoy, a disciplined young man who is about to join the army as an officer. Twenty-year-old Nikolai Ilyich pledges his love to Sonya (Sofia Alexandrovna), The eldest child of the Rostov family, Vera Ilyinichna, is cold and somewhat haughty but has a good prospective marriage in a Russian-German officer, Adolf Karlovich Berg. Petya (Pyotr Ilyich) is nine and the youngest of the Rostov family; like his brother, he is impetuous and eager to join the army when of age. The heads of the family, are an affectionate couple but forever worried about their disordered finances.<br /><br />At Bald Hills, the Bolkonskys\' country estate, Prince Andrei departs for war and leaves his terrified, pregnant wife Lise with his eccentric father Prince Nikolai Andreyevich Bolkonsky and devoutly religious sister Maria Nikolayevna Bolkonskaya.', 'releaseDate': '2015-04-13T07:00:00Z', 'artistViewUrl': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/leon-tolstoy/136840105?mt=11&uo=4', 'kind': 'ebook', 'trackViewUrl': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/war-peace/id994453808?mt=11&uo=4', 'artistIds': [136840105], 'genreIds': ['10042', '38', '9031'], 'artistId': 136840105, 'genres': ['Classics', 'Books', 'Fiction & Literature'], 'fileSizeBytes': 5468151, 'trackName': 'War & Peace', 'currency': 'USD', 'price': 5.99, 'artworkUrl60': 'http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication2/v4/97/b2/39/97b239c5-960a-b097-4e96-3931c6fa51d8/source/60x60bb.jpg', 'formattedPrice': '$5.99', 'trackId': 994453808, 'trackCensoredName': 'War & Peace', 'artistName': 'Leon Tolstoy', 'artworkUrl100': 'http://is4.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication2/v4/97/b2/39/97b239c5-960a-b097-4e96-3931c6fa51d8/source/100x100bb.jpg'}, {'description': '<i>The Peace War</i> is quintessential hard-science adventure.

These characters, particularly Pierre, Prince Andrei, and the beautiful Natasha, demonstrate different human struggles that are affected by their history, present era, and culture. They simultaneously develop the concepts on which Tolstoy expounds in the thematic essays interspersed throughout the narrative: a person&#39;s free will and the shaping of historical events, morality in an imperfect world, youth and age, marriage and death, and, of course, war and peace, in a work so groundbreaking that it was not considered a novel when published in 1865.

W. Brands, a masterful biography of the Civil War general and two-term president who saved the Union twice, on the battlefield and in the White House, holding the country together at two critical turning points in our history.</b><br /><br />Ulysses Grant rose from obscurity to discover he had a genius for battle, and he propelled the Union to victory in the Civil War. After Abraham Lincoln's assassination and the disastrous brief presidency of Andrew Johnson, America turned to Grant again to unite the country, this time as president. In Brands's sweeping, majestic full biography, Grant emerges as a heroic figure who was fearlessly on the side of right. He was a beloved commander in the field but willing to make the troop sacrifices necessary to win the war, even in the face of storms of criticism. He worked valiantly to protect the rights of freedmen in the South; Brands calls him the last presidential defender of black civil rights for nearly a century. He played it straight with the American Indians, allowing them to shape their own fate even as the realities of Manifest Destiny meant the end of their way of life.&#xa0; He was an enormously popular president whose memoirs were a huge bestseller; yet within decades of his death his reputation was in tatters, the victim of Southerners who resented his policies on Reconstruction. In this page-turning biography, Brands now reconsiders Grant's legacy and provides a compelling and intimate portrait of a man who saved the Union on the battlefield and consolidated that victory as a resolute and principled political leader.", 'releaseDate': '2012-10-02T07:00:00Z', 'artistViewUrl': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/artist/h-w-brands/202652543?mt=11&uo=4', 'kind': 'ebook', 'trackViewUrl': 'https://itunes.apple.com/us/book/the-man-who-saved-the-union/id517581640?mt=11&uo=4', 'userRatingCount': 64, 'artistIds': [202652543], 'genreIds': ['10079', '38', '9015', '9008'], 'artistId': 202652543, 'genres': ['United States', 'Books', 'History', 'Biographies & Memoirs'], 'fileSizeBytes': 13660988, 'trackName': 'The Man Who Saved the Union', 'currency': 'USD', 'price': 6.99, 'artworkUrl60': 'http://is5.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Publication2/v4/f1/4c/f7/f14cf7c8-634e-4407-9680-dfd30fb315aa/source/60x60bb.jpg', 'formattedPrice': '$6.99', 'averageUserRating': 4.0, 'trackId': 517581640, 'trackCensoredName': 'The Man Who Saved the Union', 'artistName': 'H.
